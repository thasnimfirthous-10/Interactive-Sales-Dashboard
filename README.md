Task Title: Interactive Dashboard Development using Power BI

📖 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project involved the design and development of a fully interactive sales dashboard using Power BI to enable business data visualization and analysis.
Structured sales data from a CSV file was imported, cleaned, and explored to ensure consistency and completeness. Multiple visualizations were implemented to analyze sales performance across categories, time periods, regions, and profitability.
Interactive elements, including slicers and cross-filtering, were incorporated to allow dynamic exploration of the data. The dashboard provides actionable insights into sales trends, regional contributions, and profit versus sales relationships, supporting informed, data-driven business decisions.
The project demonstrates the practical application of Business Intelligence concepts, data modeling, aggregation techniques, and interactive visualization design in a professional analytics environment.
